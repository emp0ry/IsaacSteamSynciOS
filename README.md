# IsaacSteamSynciOS

Native Steam Cloud and achievement synchronization for **The Binding of Isaac: Repentance on iOS**.

IsaacSteamSynciOS connects directly to Steam from inside Isaac. It can pull the
Steam version before play, publish a verified iPhone save, and add native-save
achievements that are still locked on Steam when the user taps **Sync Now**.
It never clears an existing Steam achievement. No Game Center, desktop
companion, Steam desktop client, server, JIT, or permanent background daemon is
required.

The same ARM64 synchronization core supports both installation modes:

| Device | Release file |
| --- | --- |
| Jailbroken iPhone or iPad | `IsaacSteamSynciOS-rootless.deb` |
| Non-jailbroken iPhone or iPad | `IsaacSteamSynciOS.dylib` |

The standalone dylib links only Apple system libraries. ElleKit is used only by
the optional rootless package to load it into Isaac.

## Features

- Direct Steam authentication with QR/Steam Mobile or login and password
- Steam Guard, email-code, refresh-token reconnect, timeout, and offline states
- Session credentials stored in the iOS Keychain
- AppID `250900` Cloud file enumeration, download, upload, commit, and
  post-upload verification
- Correct iOS raw-LZ4 to Windows/Steam save normalization
- SHA-256 local identity and Steam SHA-1 verification
- Three-way synchronization using a last-known-common `BASE`
- Automatic remote-only pull before Isaac opens progression
- Lightweight automatic upload of stable saves after returning to Isaac's menu,
  with **Sync Now** still available and automatic uploads configurable
- Ordinary-Repentance Continue transfer as a verified progression/run pair,
  tested from iOS to Windows and back
- Optional PC Mods Compatibility for the saved run's mod-state marker;
  custom Windows mod content is not ported
- Additive Steam achievement sync from native Isaac persistent saves during
  **Sync Now**; existing Steam unlocks are never cleared
- First-sync and true-conflict choices that never guess a winner
- Versioned local and remote backups with retention and restore
- Same-directory atomic local replacement with final hash verification
- Native UIKit account, sync, conflict, backup, log, and invisible-button UI
- Compact top-right **Steam ☁️** button and panel that hide automatically during a
  run and return after Isaac reaches a menu
- Steam rich presence showing AppID `250900` while Isaac is active
- Offline play without blocking game startup

## How synchronization behaves

At startup the core compares the canonical iPhone save, the Steam object, and
the last verified common hash:

Full SHA-256 and Steam SHA-1 still verify every transferred byte. The comparison
hash excludes only the save-load counter and its dependent CRC; opening a save
without changing progression must not create a conflict. The Continue stream
and its link remain part of the comparison when Continue Transfer is enabled.
Older BASE records are migrated only when an exact current snapshot or verified
backup proves the old BASE; otherwise the first-sync choice is preserved.

| iPhone | Steam | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Same as BASE | Same as BASE | Nothing changed |
| Changed | Same as BASE | Upload a stable snapshot from the menu, or wait for **Sync Now** if automatic upload is off |
| Same as BASE | Changed | Pull Steam before slot selection |
| Both changed to the same hash | Same content | Update BASE |
| Both changed differently | Conflict; ask the user |

There is no winner on the first sync. The user must choose **Use iPhone Save**,
**Use Steam Save**, or **Cancel**. Both available versions are backed up before
any destructive choice.

Launch and foreground checks compare first. A metadata-only observer checks
known save paths every two seconds; it does not repeatedly hash unchanged files.
After the files settle for at least four seconds and the native game is back in
its menu, the background worker performs a fresh three-way comparison. Only a
local-only change can upload automatically. First sync, divergence, and a remote
replacement requiring a restart still need the appropriate user action.

Use Isaac's **Save and Exit** before switching devices. A live in-memory room
cannot be transferred until Isaac writes it to disk. **Sync Now** uses the same
stable-save checks and also synchronizes missing save-derived achievements.
The worker converts native LZ4 data to the Windows stream, backs up both sides,
uploads, re-enumerates Cloud, and downloads the uploaded bytes for verification
before advancing BASE. Limited iOS background time is not treated as a permanent
daemon; interrupted or offline work is reconciled on the next launch/menu visit.

The button border is green after a verified sync, orange while pending,
connecting, or offline, and red for an error or choice that needs attention.

### Steam save generation

**Steam Save Version** supports Auto and ordinary Repentance. Auto preserves
an existing exact cloud-file binding. If both generations exist without a prior
binding, it refuses to pick by timestamp; choose Repentance explicitly.

Repentance+ synchronization is **not enabled in v1.3.0**. Preliminary format
adaptation exists in the source and has byte-round-trip tests, but full Steam
and Windows acceptance testing is deferred. Repentance+ cloud files are refused
rather than automatically converted. This release does not add Repentance+
gameplay or content to iOS.

## Achievement synchronization

Achievement synchronization reads the achievement section directly from the
three native `rep_persistentgamedata*.dat` files. It does not read or submit
Game Center achievements.

After a successful manual **Sync Now**, the core reads Steam's live AppID
`250900` achievement schema and current user-stat values. For every Isaac
achievement ID present in an iPhone save but still locked on Steam, it sets only
the corresponding missing bit. Existing Steam stat-group values are preserved,
`explicit_reset` is always false, and the result is read back from Steam for
verification. If Steam omits the current value or CRC required for a safe
additive update, the write is refused.

The direction is intentionally one-way:

| iPhone save | Steam | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unlocked | Locked | Add the missing unlock to Steam |
| Unlocked | Unlocked | Nothing changes |
| Locked | Unlocked | Keep the Steam unlock; never clear it |
| Locked | Locked | Nothing changes |

## Compatibility

- Steam AppID: `250900`
- iOS bundle identifier: `com.Nicalis.Isaac-iOS`
- Architecture: ARM64
- Minimum deployment target: iOS 15.0
- Tested native Isaac release: App Store version 1.4 with Repentance

Save discovery begins at `NSHomeDirectory()` and never hard-codes an application
container UUID. Repentance files map directly to the Steam names:

```text
Documents/Repentance/rep_persistentgamedata1.dat
Documents/Repentance/rep_persistentgamedata2.dat
Documents/Repentance/rep_persistentgamedata3.dat
```

**Continue Transfer** additionally pairs each ordinary Repentance progression
file with its sibling `rep_gamestateN.dat`. Supported runs must use the
`ISAACNG_GSR0146` stream. The run CRC and its checksum link in the progression
file are both verified. Bundle hashes include both files, so a run-only change
cannot be missed even when the progression bytes remain unchanged.

Both files are uploaded in one UFS batch and read back individually. This is
not a promise of remote transactional atomicity: a failed batch does not advance
BASE, and the backed-up versions remain available. Local pair replacement uses
a durable recovery journal; an incomplete replacement restores both old files
before startup synchronization.

Ordinary Repentance Continue has been tested in both directions through real
Steam Cloud: iOS to Windows and a Windows-saved run back to native iOS. PC Lua
mods were disabled for the initial acceptance tests. A separate slot-3 round
trip with PC Lua mods enabled also passed using PC Mods Compatibility: the
iOS-uploaded run loaded on Windows, was saved there, and loaded back on native
iOS. This verifies the tested run, not compatibility with arbitrary mod content.
Repentance+ saves and `rep_rerunstate*.dat` are not synced in this release.

**PC Mods Compatibility** is a separate, opt-in experimental setting. It marks
uploads for a PC with Lua mods enabled and adapts downloaded runs to the native
iOS modding state. A bounded structural reader locates the marker through room
and entity counts. Only that byte, the run CRC, its progression link, and the
progression CRC change. Synchronization compares the normalized iOS pair, so
this representation difference is not mistaken for progress or a conflict.

The original pair is backed up first. Mod content is **not** ported: custom
items, rooms, characters, or entities may still be missing or crash the game.
Do not use this option as a promise of general Windows-mod compatibility.
Keep PC Mods enabled while the setting is on. Unknown run layouts are refused.

## Installation

### Jailbroken devices

Install `IsaacSteamSynciOS-rootless.deb` with a package manager or `dpkg`,
then restart Isaac. The package targets rootless ElleKit installations.

### Non-jailbroken devices

Place `IsaacSteamSynciOS.dylib` in the app's `Frameworks` directory, add
the following Mach-O load command to the main executable, then sign the complete
application bundle:

```text
@executable_path/Frameworks/IsaacSteamSynciOS.dylib
```

The included patcher automates the bundle and Mach-O changes:

```sh
./tools/patch-ipa.sh Isaac.ipa Isaac-SteamSync.ipa
```

The patcher expects a decrypted ARM64 Isaac IPA and produces an unsigned output
unless `SIGNING_IDENTITY` is supplied. It does not download or include Isaac.

```sh
SIGNING_IDENTITY='Apple Development: Example' \
ENTITLEMENTS="$PWD/tools/IsaacSteamSynciOS.entitlements" \
  ./tools/patch-ipa.sh Isaac.ipa Isaac-SteamSync.ipa
```

No JIT, private entitlement, arbitrary executable memory, daemon, or jailbreak
filesystem path is required by the embedded dylib.

## Steam authentication and security

Authentication uses Valve's current Steam Connection Manager WebSocket
protocol. QR sessions are approved in Steam Mobile. Credential sessions encrypt
the password with Valve's current RSA public key before transmission and handle
the confirmation method requested by Steam.

Only the renewable refresh token is persisted. It is stored as a
Security.framework Generic Password item with
`kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`. Passwords and Steam Guard
codes remain in memory only and are cleared after submission. Disconnecting
deletes the Keychain item.

Tokens, passwords, QR URLs, saves, IPA files, certificates, and provisioning
profiles are excluded from the repository and never written to logs. Network
traffic goes directly between Isaac and Valve infrastructure.

## Backups and atomic replacement

Runtime data remains inside Isaac's own sandbox. The internal support path is
kept as `IsaacCloudSync` for compatibility with existing installations:

```text
Library/Application Support/IsaacCloudSync/
├── state/sync-state.json
├── backups/slotN/
├── logs/isaaccloud.ndjson
└── tmp/
```

At least 12 backups per slot, source, and filename are retained. A manifest records the
operation ID, source, timestamp, filename, size, SHA-256, and Steam SHA-1 when
available.

Restoring a run requires its matching progression backup from the same
operation. Restoring progression without a matching run backs up and clears
Continue rather than mixing snapshots. Restore also clears that slot's BASE,
so it cannot silently publish the restored version over Steam.

Downloads never overwrite a live save directly. The core verifies the download,
backs up the existing file, writes a unique same-directory temporary file,
flushes and `fsync`s it, renames atomically, `fsync`s the directory, and verifies
the final canonical SHA-256. Any failure before rename leaves the previous save
untouched.

## Build

Requirements: macOS, Xcode, current Rust with the `aarch64-apple-ios` target,
Python 3, and `dpkg-deb`.

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios
make test
make release
```

Release artifacts are written to `dist/`:

```text
IsaacSteamSynciOS.dylib
IsaacSteamSynciOS-rootless.deb
SHA256SUMS
```

Useful additional checks:

```sh
make audit
cargo audit --file src/core/Cargo.lock

# Optional read-only Valve CM connection test; performs no Steam login
cd src/core
cargo test --locked live_cm_directory_websocket_and_client_hello -- --ignored
```

## Verification

The release has been exercised on an iPhone14,4 running iOS 17.3.1:

- rootless ElleKit injection and standalone embedded Mach-O loading;
- QR/Steam Mobile, Steam Guard, credential login, and Keychain reconnect;
- AppID 250900 enumeration, download, upload, commit, and Steam SHA-1 check;
- save-only additive achievement synchronization, including a live update that
  added one missing Steam unlock and an idempotent repeat with zero additions;
- preservation verification confirming zero Steam achievements were cleared;
- canonical Windows save upload after decoding the native iOS raw-LZ4 form;
- first-sync backup and choice, remote-only prelaunch pull, manual Sync Now,
  atomic replacement, backup restore, and offline fallback;
- Steam presence while Isaac is foregrounded;
- lifecycle operation without a launch daemon or jailbreak-only core symbols.

The deterministic unchanged, local-only, remote-only, converged, first-sync,
conflict, save parsing, additive stat-bit update, and achievement-preservation
branches are covered by Rust tests. Public binaries are also checked for
jailbreak-only and Game Center dynamic dependencies.

The current update additionally verified ordinary Repentance Continue in both
directions with PC Mods on and off, and a queued pull applied before native
game-view startup. A private regression reproduces the real false conflict:
an unchanged iOS run plus a load-counter-only rewrite correctly allows a
remote-only Steam update. Repentance+ format adaptation was byte-round-trip
tested, but Repentance+ synchronization remains disabled in this release.

## Signing and DLC limitations

Re-signing an App Store application can change its application identifier,
Keychain access group, data-container selection, receipt validation, and access
to legitimately purchased DLC. These results depend on the signing workflow.

This project does not modify StoreKit, receipts, purchases, DLC ownership, or
game resources. Back up the application's data before replacing an existing
installation. If a re-signed build cannot validate purchased content, this
project does not bypass that limitation.

## Known limitations

- iOS does not guarantee permanent background execution. A bounded background
  task protects an active manual/automatic sync or a menu-safe background
  upload; otherwise retry on the next foreground or menu visit.
- The startup replacement boundary waits at most eight seconds for background
  network work. On timeout, the game continues locally and late replacement is
  disabled; a later remote pull may require a relaunch.
  The constructor captures save identities without blocking dyld. On the
  verified native build, the wait occurs at `AAPLAppDelegate` initialization,
  before the game view is created, using an ordinary Objective-C method override.
  Unknown startup boundaries disable automatic pre-load replacement rather than
  guessing. No executable code patching or jailbreak hook runtime is required.
- A pull or restore chosen after gameplay starts is queued for the next launch
  so progression is never replaced underneath the running game.
- Normal Apple development/distribution signing and receipt-dependent DLC
  behavior vary by signer and provisioning profile.
- Steam is an undocumented evolving client protocol. A future Valve or Isaac
  update may require a compatible project update.
